In this directory we are learning about Object Oriented Programming and pattern design, using Java. 

For this I have been guided by the application {...POO} developed by PhD. Guillermo Roberto Solarte and Eng. Luis Eduardo Muñoz Guerrero, professors of the Universidad Tecnológica de Pereira.

This knowledge is strructured by 2 modules.

# Object Oriented Programing
## Introduction
- Whatis the POO?
- Classes
- Attributes
- Methods
- Java Classes
- UML Diagram 
- Inheritance

## POO fundamental
- Encapsulation
- Plymorphism
- Overload

# Design patterns
## Creative patterns
- Singleton
- Prototype
- Factory
- Builder

## Structural patterns
- Adapter
- Decorator
- Facade
. Flyweight

## Behavioal patterns
- Chain of responsability
- Strategy
- State
- iterator

Of course, there are sessions to practice.
